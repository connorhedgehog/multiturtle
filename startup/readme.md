# Turtle scripts
These are all of the scripts you can put on a disk and have the turtles run!<br>

Slots are 1 for fuel, 2-16 for what they dig up / building materials unless stated otherwise.
## Digging
### tunnel1.lua
Tunnels straight ahead
### tunnel3.lua
Tunnels straight ahead while taking out the blocks above and below as well
## Building
### path.lua
Places blocks underneath to build a path. Doesn't break anything, just fills empty space
